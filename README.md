js-raycast - A Javascript raycast renderer
==========================================

by Avik Das

Overview
--------

`js-raycast` is a simple, self-contained implementation of a raycast renderer
that displays the rendered images in an HTML5 canvas. The implementation
supports interactive movement around the rendered scene.

Rationale
---------

This is my attempt to learn the various tricks employed by raycasting engines.
I have a graphics background, and I've implemented raytracing renderers before,
but I wanted to see what hacks were used to add interesting effects and
features to the more limited raycasting engines.

I added movement, with collision detection, for fun.

Quick Start
-----------

Open index.html in your browser. Use the arrow keys to move around.
